# Blog it

By popular demand and client requests, this personal project is built with TypeScript and Next.js. I used the Supabase API as a databse and as an authenticator. Tailwind.CSS came to the rescue for styling. I also used React-Hook-Forms and React-Responsive-Carousel for easy-to-use components.

## Description

This project has a landing page and a write/edit article page, which enables logged-in users to post and make changes to their articles. (Edit function is WIP).

The app features authentication so signed-in users can add blog posts, while visitors can only read them.

## Objective üèîÔ∏è

As a free lancer I've realized the demand for products for clients tends to be consistent - small businesses want blogs and storefronts. This project is me adapting to that market, while adding skills to my stack.
This blog started off as a Buzzfeed clone and gradually transformed into a functional app that allows user to create and edit blog posts.

tldr:

- Used Supabase as a database and for authentication
- Used Tailwind.css for styling
- Uses server-side rendering for faster loading.

## Stack üíª

### Next.js

### Supabase:

- Manages user session/authentication
- Stores user links
- Saves user profile and information

### Tailwind.CSS:

- Allows for accessible, easy to edit, in-line styling.

### Toastify:

- Easy to use library for notifications

## Executing program

- Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
