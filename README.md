# Blog it - 🚧  WIP 🚧 

By popular demand and potential client requests, this personal project is built with TypeScript and Next.js. I also will be using the Supabase API and Tailwind.CSS.

## Description 

Currently WIP - this project will have a landing page and a write article page, which will enable users to post their articles. 

The app will feature authentication so sign-up users can add blog posts, and so visitors can read them.

## Objective 🏔️
I like clones - cloning takes the pressure off of creating a new app and it allows me to practice what I know while I learn new coding skills. 
Clones also prevent me from spending too much designing the appearance of my application, allowing me to focus on functionality instead. 

tldr:
* Used Supabase as a database and for authentication
* Exploring new libraries
* Creating a user-friendly, clean-coded and live application

## Stack 💻

### Next.js

### Supabase: 

* Manages user session/authentication
* Stores user links
* Saves user profile and information

### Tailwind.CSS:

* Allows for accessible, easy to edit, in-line styling. 

### Toastify:

* Easy to use library for notifications

## Executing program 

* Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
